Vito\\'s youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito\\'s godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to influence the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz.

Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi\\'s vest, imparting that he \"sleeps with the fishes\". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo\\'s men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital; his jaw is broken by Police Captain McCluskey, who is also Sollozzo\\'s bodyguard. Sonny retaliates for the attacks on his father by having Tattaglia\\'s son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael accepts their offer to meet in a Bronx restaurant and, retrieving a planted handgun, murders them.

Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas.

Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life.  \\n  Devastated by Sonny\\'s death, Vito decides to end the feuds. Realising that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for his son\\'s murder.

To that end, he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; the older man agrees Tom should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene\\'s stake in the family\\'s casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power.
